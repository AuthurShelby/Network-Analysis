# Network-Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Python's Scapy library. It aims to extract key packet details such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, timestamps, and payloads. The collected network data is then stored in an SQL database with proper indexing for efficient querying and analysis.

To enhance network security and performance, the project implements graph algorithms to detect potential bottlenecks and anomalies in traffic flow. This can help in identifying unusual patterns, such as potential cyber threats or network congestion.
